A structure is a user defined data type that can be used to 
group elements of different type into as single unit.

-> structure can be passed as an argument as like variables

-> when we are passing an array we are passing the 
address of the first index which is reference;
-> In case of structure we are passing the copy 
a variable and not a pointer so it is call by value 
and not by reference.

-> when the structure is very large then it is not a 
good practice to pass the copy of whole structure

-> Better choice is to pass the address of the structure

->memory created in heap will remain constant,so when we 
pass adddress it is better to create memory in heap

->Array of structure as argument
